How to be a good Maintainer
===========================

General advice for contributing or maintaining:

Keep notes for your future self about what you think you should do better or different next time.

Getting Started
---------------

How do you start writing a standalone application that others can use?

**TODO**: Insert suggestions for discovering how to do this... find blog posts, reverse-engineer other applications, etc.

Reviewing Patches
-----------------

How do you review patches?

1. Read the email/pull request body to see the changes
2. Read the diff
3. Add line comments throughout the diff for anything and everything you don't understand or think should be different
4. Make sure to be courteous and be clear that you're just trying to be through

How do you decide which patch to merge first if your backlogged?

1. Look through patches you're most interested in first
2. Look for easy patches to merge (good tests, clear code, clear explanation)
3. Look for seemingly important patches
4. Look for patches that need quick merges to avoid rotting code (code that would grow stale due to conflicts with other patches)
5.
