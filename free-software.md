title: Open Source vs. Free Software
---

**Restricted Open Source**: you can look at the code but you can't do anything with it.

**"True" Open Source (free software?)**: you can look at the code, modify it, and redistribute it

**Free Software (Stallman style)**: you can look at the code, modify it, and redistribute it but you must distribute the source code with it.

**TODO**: explain why does this matter, does the group focus on the differences, etc.
