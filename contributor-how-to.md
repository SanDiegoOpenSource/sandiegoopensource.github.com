How to be a good Contributor
============================

General advice for contributing or maintaining:

Keep notes for your future self about what you think you should do better or different next time.

Read the Docs
-------------

If there are contribution guidelines, read those first.

Contribution requires conversation
----------------------------------

Contribution is a dialogue, not a monologue.  Try to start the conversation early.

A common scenario:

1. Start writing a little code to determine whether you want to do this at all (optional)
2. Submit the issue or feature request
3. Keep coding... don't wait for the contributor unless you hit a big decision you don't want to make without them

WIP: Work in Progress commit

RFC: Request for Comment

Think about your escape plan
----------------------------

Some questions to ask:

1. What if they don't like your feature request?
2. What if you wrote code and they don't like it?
3. Worst case are you going to maintain your own fork?

Empathize with the maintainer(s)
--------------------------------

Try to empathize every step of the way.

Think of a way you can make things easier for your maintainers.  Propose different solutions to make their lives easier while allowing you to contribute.

(Insert generic set example questions you might want to ask yourself to better empathize with the maintainer)

The line between persistence and annoyance
------------------------------------------

Examples:

- No one responded to your patch or issue
- Patch seems ready to merge, but no one is merging it

**TODO**: What should you do?

Keep the style consistent
-------------------------

Examples:

1. Does this mailing mostly top post or bottom post?  Do they reply inline?
2. Try to adhere to the existing code style.

When you're new to a project it's often best to conform to the existing routines unless you have a very good reason not to do so.
