Legal Issues
============

You need a license
------------------

[Software without a license is copyrighted][implicit copyright] and must not be treated as free software.

Discussion Notes (from August 2013 meetup):

- The large majority of JavaScript projects use an MIT license.
- The 2-clause BSD license is very similar to MIT, but not as widely used

**TODO**: Will the license hold up in court?

Dual-licensing
--------------

Some projects dual licensing under MIT and GPL, but this is unecessary (see [jQuery Licensing Changes][])

Dual-licensing is usually done with the GPL and a commercial license.

**TODO**: explain
