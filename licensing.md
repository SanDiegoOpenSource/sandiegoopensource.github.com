Licensing
=========

[Software without a license is copyrighted][implicit copyright] and must not be treated as free software.

Discussion Notes (from August 2013 meetup):

- The large majority of JavaScript projects use an MIT license.
- The 2-clause BSD license is very similar to MIT, but not as widely used
- Some projects dual licensing under MIT and GPL, but this is unecessary (see [jQuery Licensing Changes][])
